# Machine Learning Project - Credit Card Churn

## Background

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for any business. It can be difficult for established businesses with a broad customer base to identify customers at risk. In this project, we used a dataset of credit card customers to develop a **machine learning** model that predicts if a customer is going to leave or stay with the business.
